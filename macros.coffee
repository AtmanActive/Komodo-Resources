            Currently you can use the following snippets to add params to your
            auto completions (these will have to be located in the PHP
            abbreviations folder):

            -   phpdoc\_function
            -   phpdoc\_class
            -   phpdoc\_var

            You will have to include the star symbol (\*) in front of every line and
            you'll probably want to check the \"Maintain indentation context after
            insertion\" option.
